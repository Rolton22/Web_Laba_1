                    <h1>What is dojo</h1>
                    <p> Dojo is originally a place for meditation and other spiritual practices in Japanese Buddhism and Shintoism. Later, with the spiritualization of the Japanese martial arts bujutsu and their transformation into budo, this term also began to be used to refer to the place where training, competition and certification in Japanese martial arts such as aikido, judo, jujutsu, kendo, karate, etc. e. In the dojo, usually in the front, there is a shrine of the school and/or an image of a person important to the school who is given some form of reverence (see Rei).</p>
